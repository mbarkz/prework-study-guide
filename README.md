## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

The motivation behind this project was to use the basics of HTML, CSS and JS to create a study guide to aid with and keep track of my learning on each of those topics. 

I also used the study guide to practice using GitHub, using this platform to keep track of changes and versions.

The HMTL and CSS I found OK! Where I struggled mainly was with Git, I think earlier I must of missed a step whilst watching a video and from there I felt I encountered issues. 

I would love to write more however I am very much running out of time and want to get this deployed!
